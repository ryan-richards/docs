Once you have your app running you will want to load your dataset into the application. You have a few options for this!

## Options

### Use an API route

You could choose to use an API endpoint to handle a bulk `POST` request of data.

I have included and example endpoint for bulk loading a CSV file in the repository.

You will have to make adjustments to handle your data.

### Load data in the seed.ts

Another option is to load your dataset in the `seed.ts` file.

You'll notice there is a `faker.js` implementation that loads 500 dummy records into the database.

You could replcace this with your real dataset, either loaded from a CSV file or a JSON array of objects.

### Manually add new records in Admin Panel

If you dont have any data to start with you can use the admin panel avaiable when you login with `admin@admin.com`

You can adjust this form to suit your data and manually add new records as you need them!

### Extend the Admin panel to accept CSV upload

You could extend the current admin panel view to allow CSV file upload to bulk upload new records.
Copy the logic in the provided API route for bulk upload to get a head start.

I'm working on adding this into the repo so watch this space!
