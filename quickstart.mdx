## Setup your development environment

Learn how to pull the boring database repo and start building your own data service app.

## Requirements

You should already have your accounts setup for Resend, Fly.io and Stripe to make best use of this quick start guide.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the boring database repo">
    Ensure you have added your github profile through the boringdatabase
    dashboard. [dashboard](https://boringdatabase.com/dashboard/repo). If you
    have successfully been added as a collaborator, you can clone the repository
    locally by following these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.

    Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the root directory and open in VScode, run `npm i` to install all dependecies.

### Set up local SQlite Database

If you've never setup a SQLite database before, we recommend checking out this [tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/getting-started/what-is-sqlite/) to learn more about it.

If you are using brew you can install sqlite with `brew install sqlite` and create a new database with `sqlite3 sqlite.db`.

When you deploy your app, the dockerfile with let Fly will create it's own sqlite.db file.

### Set environment variables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Set environment variables">
    Navigate to the .env in the repository and make sure you set your values for
    the following: ``` STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="" STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="" RESEND_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Seed local SQlite with Prisma

Now you have your .env file set, you can setup your local sqlite database by running first migration of prisma and seed the database with permissions, roles, and admin user.

This seed file will also create products in your stripe dashboard. Please ensure you are using the `test` environment vairables for your stripe account until you are ready to go live!

To see how the seed file works/make any changes navigate to the `prisma/seed.ts`

`npx prisma migrate dev --name init` - will run the initial migration

`npx prisma migrate reset` - this will force the seed.ts file to run and load your database with data.

You should see success messages logged to the console.

To check the seed has worked you can run `npx prisma studio` in a new terminal window to start a database UI and explore the tables and records created.

### Start local environment

If your data has been successfully seeded you can run `npm run dev` in the terminal to start your app.

You can click one of the purchase buttons to test stripe checkout is correctly linked up.

Or try login with `admin@admin.com` at [Login](http://localhost:3000/auth/login) no One time passcode is sent via email for admin user, you can grab the passcode from the terminal of the running app.

### Launch a new Fly app

Navigate terminal 2 to the root of your project and run `fly launch`. You can
follow the prompts to create a new fly app.

If you have not logged into fly through the CLI before you will be prompted to login.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
