## Setup your development environment

Learn how to pull the boring database repo and start building your own data service app.

## Requirements

You should already have your accounts setup for Resend, Fly.io and Stripe to make best use of this quick start guide.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone the boring database repo">
    Ensure you have added your github profile through the boringdatabase
    dashboard. [dashboard](https://boringdatabase.com/dashboard/repo). If you
    have successfully been added as a collaborator, you can clone the repository
    locally by following these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Set environment variables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Set environment variables">
    Navigate to the .env in the repository and make sure you set your values for
    the following: ``` STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="" STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="" RESEND_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>
