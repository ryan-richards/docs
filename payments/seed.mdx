The `prisma/seed.ts` seed file synchronizes Stripe products and prices with a local database.

You should make chnages to the `app/modules/stripe/plans.ts` file this is where you can set plan details, like name and prices for different currencies.

When you first run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` the `seed.ts` file will run and populate your local database with users and roles.
Plus it will contact stripe and create products and prices for you.

The `seed.ts` file is designed to keep your local or production database in sync with Stripe, with Stripe acting as the source of truth.

Here's how the seed file works:

## 1. Update or Create Existing Products

The `updateOrCreateProducts` function:

- Fetches all products from Stripe
- For each product:
  - Retrieves its prices from Stripe
  - Updates or creates a corresponding record in the local database
  - Synchronizes the product's prices in the database

## 2. Create New Products

The `createNewProducts` function:

- Checks for products defined in `PRICING_PLANS` that don't exist in Stripe
- For each new product:
  - Creates the product in Stripe
  - Creates associated prices in Stripe
  - Adds the product and its prices to the local database

## Key Points

- Uses Stripe API to fetch and create products and prices
- Uses Prisma ORM to interact with the local database
- Handles both one-time ('lifetime') and recurring price models
- Ensures database reflects the current state of products in Stripe

After running this seed file, your local database will be in sync with your Stripe account's products and prices.
