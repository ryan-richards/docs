## Resend Login

Boringdatabase uses Resend to send authentication emails with one time passcodes and magic links to a user to verfiy login.
This is not required everytime as session is stored for a period of time.

You might want to modify the email sent to users. You can do that at `app/modules/email/templates/auth-email.tsx`

If you have set `site-config.ts` file you don't need to make changes here.
