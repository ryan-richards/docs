## Resend Payment Success Emails

Boringdatabase uses Resend to send payment success emails when a user purchases and subscription or lifetime plan.

You might want to modify the email sent to users. You can do that at `app/modules/email/templates/auth-email.tsx`

If you have set `site-config.ts` file you don't need to make changes here.
