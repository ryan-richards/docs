You can easily personalise your boring database site by quickly configuring the `app/site-config.ts` file

In here you can set your site name, description and configure site metadata for SEO.

## Site Config

The config file looks like this

```
export const site = {
  meta: {
    title: 'Boring Database - Datatable Boilerplate',
    description: 'Launch a Boring Database in 3 days or less.',
    keywords: 'interview, questions, ai, candidate, job, hire',
    image: 'https://demo.boringdatabase.com/og-twitter.png',
    url: 'https://demo.boringdatabase.com',


    ...
```

You should change all of these values to ensure your brand and site name is configured throughout the app.

There will still be places you have to make changes, copy on landing pages, image links etc.
